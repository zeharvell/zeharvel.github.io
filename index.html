        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
          <h3>Foreman | Coniglio Construction | March 2019- Present (June 2020)</h3>
            <p>While working at Coniglio Construction I have once again utilized my leadership skills and communication skills by speaking to customers and bidding jobs. Deciding what crew members should go to which job (two crews of four) I am in charge of making sure everyone has what they need for the day as far as materials which causes me to do lots of work behind the scenes off the clock. I also am a skilled laborer for pouring concrete, and operating heavy equipment. If I don’t show up to work, jobs can’t get done.</p>
