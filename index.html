        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
          <h3>Foreman | Coniglio Construction | March 2019- Present (June 2020)</h3>
            <p>While working at Coniglio Construction I have once again utilized my leadership skills and communication skills by speaking to customers and bidding jobs. Deciding what crew members should go to which job (two crews of four) I am in charge of making sure everyone has what they need for the day as far as materials which causes me to do lots of work behind the scenes off the clock. I also am a skilled laborer for pouring concrete, and operating heavy equipment. If I don’t show up to work, jobs can’t get done.</p>
          <h3>FLO/Warehouse Lead | Coldpoint Logistics | April 2016 – March 2019</h3>
            <p>Hired on as a forklift operator, after six months promoted to trainer after a year promoted to warehouse lead, my job included delegating assignments to a team of ten and making sure goals were made and that production was timely. Also used lots of problem solving, my line of work was lots of import/export of frozen goods so trucks would be late, goods would be expired, labels would be mixed up, goods wouldn’t be in correct location and it was my job to find a solution. In 2016 I was awarded most improved, in 2017 and 2018 I was awarded a bonus for my attendance.</p>
